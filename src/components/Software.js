            making natural hair accessible using science and technology. I
            co-designed and built software that recommended hair products with
            ingredients that matched users' hair, goals, and lifestyle â€” all
            from Black-owned businesses. oak had several web applications and a
            Chrome extension that showed which products on popular online
            storefronts (Walmart, Target, and Amazon) were Black-owned, and
            recommended similar ones from Black-owned businesses we partnered
            with. We're incredibly proud of what we built, and after three years
            of building, oak's co-founders and I turned down the company in July
            2022 to focus on other projects.
